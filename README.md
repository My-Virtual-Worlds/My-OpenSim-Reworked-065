# My-OpenSim-Reworked-065
This is my rework and refactoring of OpenSimulator version 0.6.5.1. The goal is to refactor opensimulator to be closer to virtual worlds such as Second Life while removing much of the foolshness that has crept into OpenSimulator over the years. You can help by using the issues system to report bugs, request features, etc.
